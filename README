My .emacs.d configuration is in constant flux and probably will be different from week to week. Although I try not to spend too much time tweaking, it seems to suck me in every time...

Installed emacs with Homebrew, which includes the fullscreen patch:

(sudo) brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb

mv Emacs.app to /Applications

git submodule init --recursive
git submodule update --recursive

All the default packages are defined and will be installed on the first run (could be you have to restart emacs for some packages).
